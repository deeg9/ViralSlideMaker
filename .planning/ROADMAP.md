# Roadmap: TikTok Slideshow Creator

## Overview

This roadmap delivers an AI-powered carousel image creator in 4 phases. Phase 1 lays the foundation with auth, project persistence, and app scaffolding. Phase 2 delivers the core value loop: type a prompt, get AI-generated carousel slides with stock photos, download as images. Phase 3 adds the full slide editor so users can refine AI output. Phase 4 completes the template system with style switching, brand kits, and auto-applying saved preferences.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation and Auth** - Project scaffolding, Supabase setup, authentication, project CRUD, and base UI shell
- [x] **Phase 2: AI Generation and Image Rendering** - Core value loop: prompt to AI-generated carousel slides with stock photos, server-side rendering, and download
- [x] **Phase 3: Slide Editor** - Full editing capabilities: add/remove/reorder slides, text editing, image swap/upload, undo/redo, responsive layout
- [ ] **Phase 4: Template System and Brand Kit** - Template switching post-generation, brand kit persistence, and auto-applied brand settings

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation and Auth
**Goal**: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage slideshow projects in a clean app shell

**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-03, PROJ-04, UIUX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can create an account with email/password and log in

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold Next.js app, Supabase auth setup, login/signup/logout flows
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Project CRUD, dashboard UI, app shell layout, visual checkpoint

### Phase 2: AI Generation and Image Rendering

**Requirements**: AIGEN-01, AIGEN-02, AIGEN-03, REND-01, REND-02, REND-03, REND-04, TMPL-01, TMPL-02, UIUX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can enter a text prompt and receive a complete set of carousel slides with hook text, body copy, CTA, and background images

  3. User can choose a visual style template before generating, and slides render in that style
  4. Slides render as 1080x1920 images with text overlays baked in, consistent across devices
  5. User can download all slides as a ZIP or download individual slide images
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Types, schemas, templates, AI generation + Pexels integration, generation server action
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Render API, download system, slide UI components, project page, visual checkpoint

### Phase 3: Slide Editor
**Goal**: Users can fully edit AI-generated slideshows: manipulate slides, refine text, swap images, and undo mistakes
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: EDIT-01, EDIT-02, EDIT-03, EDIT-04, EDIT-05, EDIT-06, EDIT-07, EDIT-08, EDIT-09, EDIT-10, AIGEN-04, AIGEN-05, UIUX-02

- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Editor UI components, dnd-kit drag-and-drop, server actions, image picker, project page integration, checkpoint

### Phase 4: Template System and Brand Kit
**Goal**: Users can switch visual styles after generation and save brand preferences that auto-apply to new slideshows
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: TMPL-03, TMPL-04, TMPL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can switch templates after generation and all slides re-render in the new style
